# 02_responsive_portfolio

## Objective
The objective of this website is to create a mobile first responsive web page using bootstrap that can be properly viewed on all devices, phones, tablets, and computers. 

## Description
This is my portfolio website showcasing my work, and details about me. Designed to be mobile first, the website includes an about me page, contact page, and a portfolio of my work. During the project I faced problems with properly aligning my columns within the HTML files, as well as designing my website in a way that makes it easy to navigate.
